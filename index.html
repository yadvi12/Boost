 <p><em><u>How to learn Programming</u>?</em></p>
</h3>
<hr>

<ol>
  <h3>
    <li><u>Get Familiar with a Programming language</u></li>
  </h3>
  <h4>
    <p>Getting comfortable with a programming language is the first step towards learning programming. People often start with C, C++, Java, or Python. I personally prefer C++ in the beginning as it is neither too simple (like Python is), nor too
      deficient in terms of libraries (like C is). C++ is pretty fast and has a good library support too - best of both worlds!</p>
  </h4>
  <hr>
  <h3>
    <li><u>Learn Data Structures and Algorithms</u></li>
  </h3>
  <h4>Once you are comfortable with any of the languages mentioned in the above section, the next thing you should do is learning data structures and algorithms. Data structures and algorithms help in building the right aptitude required for
    programming. Knowledge about the data structures will help you in choosing the right one for the problem you are solving - not all data structures can be used everywhere.</h4>
  <hr>
  <h3>
    <li><u>Get your hands with competitive programming</u></li>
  </h3>
  <h4>Once you have learned data structures and algorithms, you should start solving problems on websites like SPOJ, Codechef, Codeforces, Topcoder, Hackerrank, Geeksforgeeks etc. The more problems you solve, the better it is. </h4>
  <hr>
  <h3>
    <li><u>Make a Project</u></li>
  </h3>
  <h4>Now that you have enhanced your problem-solving and programming skills, it is time to create some useful applications. You can pick up some popular web development framework (Django, Flask, Ruby on Rails, etc.) and make a project using it.
    Making an application will give you a feel of actual software development, which is what most of the programmers do</h4>
  <hr>
  <h3>
    <li><u>Explore</u></li>
  </h3>
  <h4>Once you are confident about your programming skills and have made some projects, you should now go on to explore the various domains of Computer Science and see what fascinates you the most.</h4>
